# HungryHub Project Notes

## Backend Setup: Folder Structure 
- Open terminal
    - Type `npm init -y`
        - this will install the package.json file so that different npm packages can be installed. 
    - Type `npm i express cors dotenv mongodb mongoose`
        - express: it's used on the backend to handle the API requests that come from the frontend.
        - cors: it helps to configure the backend to accept or block requests that come from different domains and ports and stuff like that. 
        - dotenv: it's used to load environment variables. 
        - mongodb and mongoose: used to help interact with the database in a developer friendly way from the backend code. 
    - Type `npm i ts-node typescript nodemon @types/express @types/cors @types/node --save-dev`
        - typescript: it's going to install typescript into the project and will provide a config file which will enable adjustment of typescript settings.
        - nodemon: it will allow hot-reloading which means that whenever changes are made to the backend code the server will automatically restart and provide the latest changes. 
        - the `@types...` provides the types for the previously installed packages which helps get intellisense and stuff like that. 
    - Open package.json file in order to change some properties
        - go to the main property and change from `"main": "index.js"` to
        `"main": "./src/index.ts"`
        - go to the scripts and delete the properties and instead it should say `"scripts": { "dev" : "nodemon" },`
- Open up the terminal again
    - Type `npx tsc --init`
- Go back into the VSCode explorer
    - Create a new folder called `src`
    - Inside of the `src` folder create a new file called `index.ts`
        - Inside the `index.ts` folder it will be used to 
            - Initialize Express 
            - Add API routes
            - Add connections to Stripe and MongoDB
            - Define roots
            - Start the server
- Go to the `index.ts` file inside the `src` folder
    - There are notes there to understand what was typed up
- Go to the terminal
    - Type `npm run dev` and below are the results
    ![Example](https://i.imgur.com/7YFSuya.png)
    - It just shows that it is following where I told it to go in the `package.json` file has the console message. 
- Open up a browser tab
    - Type `localhost:7000/test` and below are the results

    - It proves that the backend server has started and that I can make requests.

## Backend Setup: Database
- Go to the [MongoDB website to install a database](https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/66340f4fa3c74170c37f989b#/overview)
    - Click `database` button on the left hand menu
    - Click the free tier option
    - Choose the region which is closer to you for the fastest connection
    - Change the cluster to the name of your project for proper database identification
    - Setup username: admin, password: it's autogenerated and it keep it handy for soon use in the connection string inside of the `.env` file.
    - Connect to the local environment
    - Make sure the IP address is identified and used for security reasons.
        - It means that requests to my database are going to be allowed in and prevents someone from entering and seeing the database.
    - Click `finish and close`
    - Go to `overview`
    - It takes a moment to process, but once the cluster has been provisioned there should be a `connect now` option, click it.
    - Click the `connect` button
    - A new page will appear that will offer options to connect to the MongoDB Driver
        - `Select your driver and version` option
        - And a `Install your driver` option
    - Copy the connection string
    - Create an `.env` file 
        - Create a new property
        - Paste the database connection string into this file.
        - Retrieve your password saved from earlier.
        - Highlight the `<password>` string and replace it with your saved password that you created for your user. 
            - The reason that we put this code into an environments file is because whenever we deploy the code I can change this property using the deployment tool depending on the environment I am going to deploy to. 
                - For example, if I were deploying to a development environment I would use the current connection string but if deploying to a production environment there might be a different database that I want to connect to then I would have to configure that in my pipeline and it would change the value there in the `.env` fie and it also means I would have to go and dig for my code to change connection strings etc. 
                - In the future I will learn how to exclude the info inside of the `.env` file so that it does not get exposed on the internet. 
    - Go to the `index.ts` file
        - This is the entry point for my server
        - At the top of the app type
        ```jsx
        import mongoose from "mongoose";

        mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING as string).then(()=> console.log("Connected to database!"))
        ```
        - Now you can connect to the database and the console.log statement will tell you if you are connected.
        - Go to the terminal and type `npm run dev`
        - It should tell you if you nodemon has started, the server has started, and you're connected to the database!

## Frontend Setup: Folder Structure
- Go to the [Shadcn website in the Docs section to install and configure Vite](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/vite)
    - Follow the directions there
    - Create `global.css` file
        - Add required content from Shadcn documentation

## React Router Setup
- Open terminal
    - Type `npm i react-router-dom`
    - Create `AppRoutes.tsx` file
    - Add code to the `main.tsx` and `AppRoutes.tsx` files
        - A trick to copy a line of code onto the line beneath it is press alt + shift + arrow down.
    - Go to the browser tab where the app is and type `localhost:5173/user-profile`
        - It should go to a page where it says `USER PROFILE PAGE`
    - If you refer to the third route component in the `AppRoutes.tsx` file its job is to route any urls that aren't specified as `http://localhost:5173/homepage` or `localhost:5173/user-profile` to the homepage only its url will be `http://localhost:5173/`.

## Project UI Buildout

    - `App.css`
